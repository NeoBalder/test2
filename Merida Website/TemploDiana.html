		<p id="Diana">The Temple of Diana was built in the municipal forum of the Roman city following 
the usual configuration of the temples of classical antiquity.<br>
<br>
The temple has been called "Diana's" since a local historian identified it as such in the 17th century. 
However, in the archaeological excavations around the building, several sculptural images have been found 
at different times that have allowed us to discern the real use of the temple, which was dedicated to the 
imperial cult, and it must have been one of the main temples of the city, judging by the preeminent 
place it occupied in the urban space.<br>
