		<p id="Aqueduct">The Roman aqueduct of Merida was built during Roman times to supply water to the
west side of the city of Merida. The water collection point for the aqueduct was
located in the Proserpina reservoir, where a pipeline of about 11 kilometers long began.<br>
<br>
The aqueduct is 827 meters long and has a maximum height of 25 meters.
It's exact date of construction is unknown, although most studies date it approximately
during the Roman Julius-Claudian dynasty.<br>
