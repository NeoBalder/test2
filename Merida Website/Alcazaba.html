		<p id="Citadel">The Arab Citadel of Merida was built by order of Abderraman II in the year 835
as a bastion to control the city, which for two decades had continually rebelled
against the emirate's rule.<br>
<br>
This makes it the oldest Muslim fortification preserved in the
Iberian Peninsula.<br>
<br>
It consists of a square enclosure of 130 meters on each side. Inside there is an
underground cistern of water filtered from the Guadiana River. The walls, made of 
granite, are 2.7 meters thick and 10 meters high.<br>
<br>
The Alcazaba was accessed from the Roman bridge through a small fortified
enclosure called a "alcazarejo", which controlled the passage of people and
merchandise into the city.<br>
