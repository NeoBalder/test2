		<div><p id="Amphitheater">Merida's Amphitheatre was built at the same time as the theatre, at the end of the
first century BC and was in use until the fourth century AC. Then, due to
abandonment, both the theatre and the amphitheatre were almost completely buried.<br>
<br>
It was at the beginning of the 20th century that new archaeological excavations 
rediscovered both, with the good fortune that the entire buried part of the structures, 
which was the great majority, was thus protected from the elements and people, 
so its state of preservation is much higher than that of similar works, 
especially in the case of the theatre.<br>
