	<div><p>Mérida was founded as a Roman colony in 25 BC by order of Emperor Octavio Augusto 
to serve as a place of retreat for veteran soldiers (emeritos), hence its original 
Roman name "Emerita Augusta".<br>
<br>
Considered then one of the most important cities in Hispania, it was provided with 
all the comforts of a large Roman city and served as the capital of the Roman province 
of Lusitania.<br>
<br>
Mérida passed into Muslim hands in 713 AD and was renamed Mārida Andalusí.
It continued to be the most important population centre in western Al-Andalus.<br>
<br>
The city returned to Christian hands in 1230 during the decline of the Muslim reign in
Al-Andalus.<br>
<br>
In 1983 it was designated capital of the autonomous community of Extremadura in 
recognition of its past splendour.<br>
<br>
Merida has one of the largest archaeological heritages (mainly Roman)
in Spain. In recognition of this heritage, the city of Rome sent to Merida in
1997 a reproduction of its famous statue, the "Capitoline Wolf".<br>
