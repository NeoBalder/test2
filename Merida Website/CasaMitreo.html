		<p id="CMitreo">The House of Mithraeum is one of the best examples of a Roman domus (stately home) 
still standing today. It was built at the end of the first century BC and abandoned 
at the end of the fourth century.<br>
<br>
It begins with an entrance hall, an Atrium for offerings and a Tablinum where the dominus 
managed his business. There are also several rooms, a cistern and two courtyards, 
one of them with a pond. Numerous mosaics have also been preserved with big success.<br>
