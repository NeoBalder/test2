-Hometown Homepage - Merida, Extremadura, Spain

This projects aims to be not a website of Merida in the present, but about the old Merida, the roman city.

That is why, the main page shows the original roman name of Merida, "Emerita Augusta".

Once you enter you can learn a bit about the history of Merida and access an interactive map of the city, in which you will see buttons located where some of the main historical attractions can be found.

Upon clicking any of those buttons you will access the relevant section which contains more information about that place.

One of the things I struggled with, was placing the text on each section in the less disrupting position possible. Ideally it would be a small icon that would transform in a text box upon clicking on it, thus allowing the user to see the full picture instead of forcing the text to cover part of it.

This is the main thing that I plan to improve in the future, as well as adding a "go back" button to each section, which I didn´t have time to do this time.

The website includes links to Merida´s touristic website and to the Museum of roman art.

-Technologies Used

HTML
CSS

-Features:

	Custom font for the welcoming page: Minecraft font via "font-family" to give it an old-looking style
	Text boxes with custom size, background color and position, to fit as well as possible with the background image of their respective sections.
	Interactive buttons positioned in the aerial map to fit the location of the place they show, they have a picture of the location, a border to highlight them, and when hovering over them they grow a bit and the name of the place is shown.
	An extra button inside the Theater section is positioned where a first person view of the front would be, and upon clicking on it, a first person view picture is displayed, as the user would see it if they were standing on that place of the map.
	An extra button inside the Museum section is placed on the opened doors, an upon clicking on them we access another section with a picture from inside the museum and information about it, trying to give the user the impression of entering the building.

The website is not responsive at the time, which is something else I plan on improving in the future

After implementing feedback from the slack channel, I have added a border to the main page button to make it more evident that is clickable,  have added a new button to each section to
go back to the previous one, I have added the title in all pages in which was missing and used https://validator.w3.org/ to check for errors on my html documents.

After completting the programming-blocks step of the course, I have added an image carousel in the museum page so the user can see pictures of some of the exhibits.
