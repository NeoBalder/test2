		<p id="Theater">The Roman Theatre of Merida was built together with the adjacent amphitheatre at the time of the foundation of the city, 
		and was inaugurated between the years 16 and 15 BC.<br>
<br>
The Theatre responded more to political interests than to the tastes of the Roman people, who
preferred chariot races and fights between gladiators and animals. From the
theatre, the authority carried out propaganda of itself and of the Roman way of life.<br>
<br>
With a capacity of more than 3,000 people, it is one of the most lively classical theatres in
all of Europe, as it continues to host major events every year such as the MÃ©rida International Classical Theatre Festival.<br>
