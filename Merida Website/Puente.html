		<p id="Bridge">Built when the city was founded, it marks its layout as an extension of one of the main
arteries of the colony. Its location was carefully selected in a ford of the 
Guadiana River, which offers as a support point an island that divides the river in two.<br>
<br>
In Roman times, the bridge was extended in length several times to prevent the road 
from being cut off by the periodic flooding of the Guadiana River. 
That is why, with 792 meters in length, it is the longest preserved
and still in use Roman bridge in the world.<br>
